This file requires an actual MP3 binary audio file. Since I cannot generate binary audio content in text format, the developer needs to replace this file with a real MP3 audio file. The file should be obtained from royalty-free sources, audio sample libraries, or custom-created audio content converted to MP3 format and placed at public/audio/sample1.mp3
